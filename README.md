# TelegramTweetCatcher
A Telegram bot that fetches new tweets from an unrestricted list.

Fill both the Twitter api keys as well as the Telegram bot key in the external txt file

Run - sudo Python3 main.py

# Commands
/Start - Starts the bot and searches for new tweets every 15 seconds, will only post if tweet is new

# Current Plans
This version currently doesnt use twitter's streaming api and relys on simple waits and updates. I'd like to make a seperate version of this app that uses twitter's streaming method.
